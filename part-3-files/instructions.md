You have just been hired by TLC as a computer engineer. How cool is that!

It's your first day, and your boss walks into your office with a USB key. 
They are working on some new, classified, extra-trash reality TV, and they just got back the complete list of candidates. 
Problem is they are too many, and the direction wants it reduced to 20 people by tomorrow.

"Don't worry," your boss says "during our many years of crappy entertainment, we compiled a list of yes and no, to quickly select the best contestant. We only want la crème de la crème, you know. We have a reputation."

He hands you the USB key. "Here's the list of candidates."

Then, he takes out some dirty piece of paper. "And here are the rules. Now excuse me, I have to go and tame some wild eagles." 

The paper is oily and smells like barbecue sauce. You don't like it. On it, you read:

>*__Rules to get the best contestants [CLASSIFIED]__* <br>
Our R&D team did a lot of super secret research and came up with this rules to get the best contestants! <br>
Accepted candidates must satisfy **at least 3** of these rules:<br>
\- Older than 65 or younger than ~~14~~ 24;<br>
\- Divorced / widowed;<br>
\- First name that contains "ED";<br>
\- Last name with length multiple of 3, 4 **or** 5; <br>
\- Coming from Florida, California, Texas, Nevada or Ohio; <br>
\- Bonus point for Florida and Texas!; <br>
\- Was involved in a legal process 3 times or more.<br>
**DO NOT ACCEPT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE:**<br>
\- People called Charles (because f- Britain, US land of the f-ing free!);<br>
\- People from New Hampshire (our narrator cannot pronounce it);<br>
\- Underage people.<br>

You ask yourself how you ended up here. Well, you ended up here because I'm the narrator, and you have no free will. 

You take out your PC, insert the USB key and get ready to work. Will you be able to satisfy your boss before he unleashes his domesticated eagles against you?
