# Part 3
Today we are going to talk about structures and files. Enjoy!

## Structures
Structures can be used to pack together different variables, using an object-programming-kinda fashion. 

Defining a `struct` is pretty straightforward:
```c
struct _student_ {
    char name[33]; // 32 + 1, string '\0'
    int age;
    float gpa;
};
```
Fields in a structure can be accessed with the `.` operator:
```c
// in the main
struct _student_ jean_luc;
jean_luc.age = 69;
```

Now, we just defined a new `struct _student_` type. That's great! 
However, writing `struct _student_` every time we want to deal with a student variable is long, and makes the code heavier.

For this reason, we can create an alias using `typedef`:
```c
typedef struct _student_ student;
```
In C libraries, you'll find `typedef` _everywhere_, since many weird types are just standard ints and longs in disguise. Some examples?
```c
// the value returned by sizeof() is just an unsigned long. But size_t sounds a lot better!
typedef unsigned long size_t
// the time (in seconds) is nothing but a long with a fancier name.
typedef long time_t
// the id of a process is a simple int. Who could have seen that coming!
typedef int pid_t
```

But let's go back to structs.

Sometimes it could be useful to define functions to initialize and print a struct:
```c
student init_student(char* name, int age, float gpa) {
    student new;
    strncpy(new.name, name, 32);
    new.age = age;
    new.gpa = gpa;
    return new;
}

void print_student(student stud) {
    printf("This is %s, they're %d years old and their GPA is %.2f\n", stud.name, stud.age, stud.gpa);
}
```

### `struct` + `malloc`
Of course, it's possible to dynamically allocate structures. For example, if you want to create an array of `N` students, you can rely on the classic:
```c
// CORRECT âœ…
student* class = malloc(N * sizeof(student));
// do some computations
free(class);
```
You can also create structures with dynamically allocated fields. *__This is where you must be VERY CAREFUL__*.

Let's say you want to dynamically allocate the name, so that there is no 32-char limit on it. In that case, you might create a new, dynamic version of `struct _student_`:
```c
struct _student_d_ {
    char* name; // we will allocate this field with malloc
    int age;
    float gpa;
};
```
Now, you _might_ be tempted to do this, but you _shouldn't_:
```c
// WRONG ðŸš«
struct _student_d_ john_locke;
john_locke.name = strdup("john locke");
// strdup == malloc+strcpy
```
This is not a good programming practice, for 2 reasons:
1. A manual variable inside an automatic package -- Since `name` is dynamically allocated, you (the programmer) are the one that chooses when to create and free it. On the other hand, `john_locke` is a static variable, so it follows the usual scope rules.
2. Splitting responsibility (see [Part 1](../part-1-basics/README.md#6-dynamic-arrays-with-malloc)) -- `name` is, in a way, _hidden_ inside a nice struct package, therefore the struct should be in charge of allocating and freeing it!

To avoid confusion (and memory leaks), a structure with a dynamic field should be dynamically allocated altogether.
```c
// CORRECT âœ…
// aliasing --> notice that now we are aliasing the POINTER!
typedef struct _student_d_* student_d;
```
Since now `student_d` is a _pointer_, accessing each field requires dereferencing (`*` operator). However, writing `(*stud).name` is horrendously complex. This is where the `->` operator comes in!
```c
// CORRECT âœ…
student_d john_locke = init_student_d("john locke", 42, 3.9);
printf("%s\n", john_locke->name);
// this is the equivalent to (*john_locke).name, but much more readable!
```
Now that all the pieces are at their place, we can look at the utilities' implementation:
```c
// CORRECT âœ…
// utilities
student_d init_student_d(char* name, int age, float gpa) {
    student_d new = malloc(sizeof(struct _student_d_));
    // strdup == malloc+strcpy
    new->name = strdup(name);
    new->age = age;
    new->gpa = gpa;
    return new;
}
// now we also need the free
void free_student_d(student_d stud) {
    // first, free the name
    free(stud->name);
    // then, free the student
    free(stud);
}
void print_student_d(student_d stud) {
    printf("This is DYNAMIC %s, they're %d years old and their GPA is %.2f\n", stud->name, stud->age, stud->gpa);
}
```
Overall, allocating fields with `malloc` makes the whole struct deal much more complex, so you should take it into account when designing a program

And that's all for structures!

## Files
Time to talk about files! In C, there are 2 ways to interact with files:
1. Binary I/O (`read()`/`write()`);
2. Formatted I/O (`scanf()`/`printf()` family).

If you have a binary file, you should use binary I/O. If you have a textual file (e.g., a csv), go with formatted I/O.

### Formatted I/O
In most cases, formatted I/O is the way to go, so I'll start from here. Files can be quite boring, so I'll keep it simple.

#### Opening and closing the file
First, you need to open the file. This can be done with [`fopen()`](https://linux.die.net/man/3/fopen) (formatted open).
```c
#include <stdio.h>
FILE *fopen(const char *path, const char *mode);
```
`path` is the name of the file, `mode` is a string that determines whether we want to read (`"r"`), write (`"w"`), or append (`"a"`) to the file. There are other, more specific modes. If you are curious, look at the documentation.

In the formatted I/O approach, files are `FILE *` objects. `FILE` is a typedef for a structure that represents streams:
```c
// Told you, this typedef fella is everywhere
typedef struct _IO_FILE FILE
```
This structure is _opaque_, meaning that its fields are kept hidden to the programmer, and shouldn't be directly accessed/manipulated. Some `FILE *` exists for standard input (`stdin`), output (`stdout`) and error (`stderr`).

Once you are done, you have to close the file.
```c
int fclose(FILE *fp); 
```

#### `fscanf` and `fprintf`
Now it's time to actually read/write. To do so, there are 2 families of functions: `scanf()` to read and `printf()` to write.

They are _families_ because each of them exists in 3 different flavours: classic (e.g., `printf`), string (`sprintf`) and file (`fprintf`). The first letter determines the type of I/O stream:
- No prefix : standard I/O (the terminal);
- `s` : a string;
- `f` : a file.

I will mainly focus only on the `f` variations, but no worries! They all work the same way.

Introducing `fprintf`!
```c
int fprintf(FILE *stream, const char *format_string, ...);
```
- `stream` is the file pointer we got from `fopen`. Easy. 
- `format_string` is the message we want to write. In the message, each variable is substituted with a placeholder according to its type (this is why it's called "format").
- Finally, you need to pass the variables that must be inserted in the format string, in the order in which they appear.

All this complex mumbo-jumbo to simply say:
```c
int result;
// do some computations
fprintf(stdout, "Result: %d\n", result);
//         ^              ^        ^
//         |              |        |
//         `- file        |        `- variable to substitute in the first placeholder
//                        `- placeholder for `int` variables 
```
There are a lot of format specifiers. Some of the most common are:

| Specifier | Type |
| :-------: | :--- |
| __%d__ | int |
| __%x__ | int (hexadecimal) |
| __%f__ | float |
| __%s__ | string |
| __%c__ | char |
| __%p__ | pointer |

It's also possible to specify the number of fractional digits, the minimum number of overall digits and a lot of other things. If you have specific requirements on how your output must look like, Stack Overflow is your friend! 

Here comes the annoying bit, `fscanf`. On the surface, it looks like the same old `printf` deal.
```c
int fscanf(FILE *stream, const char *format_string, ...);
```
- `stream` is the file pointer. Basic. 
- `format_string` is how the message we want to read looks like. This is the complex part.
- In a dual way to `printf`, you need to pass the *__addresses__* where you want the values to be stored, one per placeholder.
